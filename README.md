### Fun fact about my name

The official [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese) of my last name [黃](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_(surname)) is **HUANG** as in [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese) for [Standard Northern Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese) because of my mainland Chinese roots. However, I have grown keen on the Hong Kong culture and its Cantonese language, which romanizes the character as **WONG** (in [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping)). Hence, you may also refer to me as such unofficially. 

My native language is [New Xiang Chinese (Urban Changsha)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Xiang), and hence the more accurate romanization of my last name by which my families call me is **WAN** or **WAAN**. (Similar to how you would say 玩 in Standard Northern Mandarin) Similar to Cantonese, my mother tongue does not differentiate between 黃 and 王 by sound, either.
