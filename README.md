### Fun fact about my name

The official [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese) of my last name 黃 is [**HUANG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_(surname)) as in [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) for [Standard Northern Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese) because of my mainland Chinese roots. However, I have grown keen on the Hong Kong culture and its Cantonese language, which romanizes the character as [**WONG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_(surname)) (in [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping)). Hence, you may also refer to me as such unofficially. 

My native language is [New Xiang Chinese (Urban Changsha)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Xiang), and hence the more accurate romanization of my last name by which my families call me is **WAN** or **WAAN**. (Similar to how you would say 玩 in Standard Northern Mandarin) Similar to Cantonese, my mother tongue does not differentiate between 黃 and 王 by sound, either. 

In the history of Chinese romanization, "father of Pinyin" and [supercentenarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercentenarian), [Zhou Youguang (Chow Yu-kuang)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Youguang) is my personal hero, not only because of his work romanizing Chinese in the era of [leaning to one side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_to_One_Side) of the [Cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabets) Soviet Union ([Tang Shizeng's interview](https://youtu.be/V-Cg6d8eaKU?t=121)), but also because of his [great personalities and values](https://www.npr.org/2011/10/19/141503738/at-105-celebrated-chinese-linguist-now-a-dissident).
